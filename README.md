## Testing 

I tested the site personally on my Iphone device, going through the entire process, checking buttons, functions, checking out, etc. I was personally unable to test on android.
The site was sent to friends and relatives for them to follow the same process. They have tested on their devices, including android.
Chrome was utilised to inspect the site in mobile format, going through the pages and functions.
